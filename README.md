## Things to try for logistics
- [x] use a random forest on a small amount of data to create interactions for logistic regressions
- [x] use random forest to exclude variables from logistic
- [ ] use p-val tests to exclude variables
- [x] create a bunch of random variables and then use the above methods to trim them down to a reasonable list
- [ ] use lasso to select variables
- [x] use two layers of logistic regressions (both including and excluding original variables in the last step)
- [x] year X important variables are probably worth something, things change over time or so I hear?
- [ ] try many layers with many different logistics
- [ ] try to use names to create separate logistics for variable clusters and combine this with many layers
- [ ] tune first layers
