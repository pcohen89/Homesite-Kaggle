## Things to try for logistics
- [ ] use a random forest on a small amount of data to create interactions for logistic regressions
- [ ] use random forest to exclude variables from logistic
- [ ] use p-val tests to exclude variables
- [ ] create a bunch of random variables and then use the above methods to trim them down to a reasonable list
- [ ] use lasso to select variables
- [ ] use two layers of logistic regressions (both including and excluding original variables in the last step)
- [ ] year X important variables are probably worth something, things change over time or so I hear?
